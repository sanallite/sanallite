- 👋 Hi, I’m @sanallite, last name Teodoro; I'm a 24 years old student who started learning coding last year.
- 👀 I’m interested in first specializing on the front-end languages before diving deeper into other topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in my course the development of back-end systems, using mainly php and mysql.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my personal projects for now.
- 📫 How to reach me... nowhere for now.
