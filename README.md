- 👋 Hi, I’m @sanallite, Márcio Teodoro; I'm a 25 years old student who started learning to code in 2023, in a technical course.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more JavaScript, then jumping into TypeScript and React Native Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently solidifying my understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate only on my personal projects for now.
